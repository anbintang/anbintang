## Projects

### 1. **3D Web Developer Portfolio (In Progress)**  
A modern, interactive **3D web portfolio** designed to showcase projects, skills, and professional experience through motion and storytelling.  
This project explores combining traditional UI with real-time 3D graphics and smooth animations to create an immersive developer experience.

#### What I Learned from This Project
- Structuring a **React application** with reusable and scalable components
- Using **Vite** for faster development cycles and optimized builds
- Integrating **Three.js** into React to render and manage 3D scenes in the browser
- Understanding camera control, lighting, and object composition in real-time 3D
- Creating smooth, timeline-based animations using **GSAP**
- Coordinating UI animations with 3D object interactions
- Balancing **visual richness and performance**, especially on lower-end devices
- Shifting from page-based layouts to **experience-driven interfaces**

This project helped me grow beyond conventional SPA development and think more holistically about **interaction, motion, and performance** in modern web experiences.

**Tech Stack:** React, Vite, Three.js, GSAP, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, CSS  
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress

### 2. Amdalnet (Ministry of Environment of Indonesia)
AMDALNet is a **national-scale environmental approval platform** used to manage and process environmental feasibility documents across Indonesia.  
The system supports end-to-end workflows for project registration, document verification, assessment, and decision-making, enabling faster, more transparent, and standardized environmental permitting.
In this project, I worked on developing and maintaining SPA-based features, implementing workflow-driven business logic, optimizing performance, and integrating RESTful APIs within a large collaborative engineering team.
**Tech Stack:** Laravel, Vue.js, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, REST API, Node.js (tooling), GitLab, Docker
